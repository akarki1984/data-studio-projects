        (DOFE) issued 786,564 permits for foreign employment to over one hundred destination countries.</p>

      <p class="body-text">Figures from the Department of Foreign Employment of Nepal have shown that over 176,000 Nepali women were granted labour permits to work abroad since 2008, traveling mainly to the UAE, Kuwait, Malaysia, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Cyprus and Jordan. Since 2016, Nepali authorities outlawed labour permits for domestic work in the Gulf amidst reports of  abuse of Nepali migrants working as maids in the region.</p>
